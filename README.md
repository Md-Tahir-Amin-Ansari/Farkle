# 🎲 Farkle - A Dice Game

## 📖 Overview
Welcome to **Farkle**, a digital adaptation of the classic dice game! This project was created to:
- Practice my **JavaScript** skills.
- Explore game development concepts.
- Recreate the fun of the dice game inspired by **Kingdom Come: Deliverance (KCD)**.

This version of Farkle includes:  
✨ A **custom scoring system** for a unique gameplay experience.  
🎮 An **interactive and responsive interface**.  
💻 Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Roll six dice and look for scoring combinations based on the custom rules.
2. Bank your points or roll the remaining dice to try for more!
3. Be careful—if no dice score, you’ll **Farkle** and lose your points for that turn!
4. The player with the highest score wins.

For detailed scoring rules, refer to the in-game guide.
